# INTAL-Integers-of-Arbitrary-Length
The maximum limit of unsigned long int in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, which is a 20 digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers).

C by default has no such support.

This mini project aims to bring that support to C language along with basic Arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Substraction, 
and Multiplication along with applications like Factorial, Fibonacci, etc.
